The robot control program enables the automatic generation of handwritten text based on responses obtained from a language model (LLM).
The program works by posing questions to the LLM, which generates a textual response. This response is then transformed into a vector graphic in SVG format, imitating handwritten text using ![Handwriting-Synthesis](https://github.com/sjvasquez/handwriting-synthesis).
The generated SVG file is converted into G-code, which can be used in robot control software such as G-code sender.
